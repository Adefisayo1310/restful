This project is for use on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.  
The ```.npmrc``` file fixes permission issues for the ```NPM sharp``` package and other packages which require elevated permissions, setting the 'unsafe-perm' flag to ```true```. Several packages are included in the ```package.json``` file which are not being used in this project to demonstrate the deployment works for image upload/resizing packages.     

Running this code locally requires that you add a ```.env``` file at the root of your project with a ```DB``` environment variable pointing to your local MongoDB instance.  Example: ```DB=mongodb://localhost:27017/notes?retryWrites=true```
